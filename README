           Triplane Classic - a side-scrolling dogfighting game

Intro
=====

Triplane Classic is a side-scrolling dogfighting game featuring solo
missions and multiplayer mode with up to four players. It is a port of
the original Triplane Turmoil game for DOS and aims to match the
original game exactly so that high scores remain comparable to the
original.

Please read the manual page for information on how to actually play
the game. Also see README.install if you want to build the game from
source code.
